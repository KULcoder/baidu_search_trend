      <h2 class="hero-author">By Keyu Long</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">
        We don't always need direct data to gauge the situation. When the People's 
        Republic of China<span class="footnote">1</span> eased the nationwide lockdown policy at the end of 2022, 
        they also ceased the release of daily COVID-19 data. Nonetheless, we can still
        get a sense of the situation by examining the search trends on Baidu, 
        China's most popular search engine.
